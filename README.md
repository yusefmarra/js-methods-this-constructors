# JavaScript - Methods, `this`, and Constructors

## Setup Instructions

1. Install [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html) via `npm install -g jasmine` (if necessary).
1. Run `jasmine` within the project directory to watch all but one test fail.
1. Write the appropriate code in the *book_reader.js* and *taxi.js* files to get all the tests to pass, one by one. The first test should pass. See the code in *book_reader.js* for details.
